#+OPTIONS: toc:nil ^:{}

* Style

  First, I like the compact style of the CTEs, and putting the closing
  parentheses on the same line. I would say, though, that I find the
  select statements a bit hard to read.  Especially the main one.

** Use prefix aliases for columns

   This is not standard SQL, but t-sql can do this: prefix aliases.
   In general, when writing long expressions, it gets harder to read
   the query and to find what you are looking for.  So:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT DATEPART(hour, OrderCloseTime) AS Hour,
         OrderType,
         SUM(OrderGuests) AS GuestCount,
         ROUND(CASE WHEN SUM(OrderGuests) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE SUM(OrderSubTotal) / SUM(OrderGuests) END, 2) AS AvgPerGuest,
         SUM(OrderSubTotal) AS Subtotal,
         ISNULL(SUM(Coupons), 0) * - 1 AS Coupons,
#+END_SRC

   can be more clear when you write it as

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
   SELECT Hour = DATEPART(hour, OrderCloseTime)
        , OrderType
        , GuestCount = SUM(OrderGuests)
        , AvgPerGuest = ROUND(CASE WHEN SUM(OrderGuests) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE SUM(OrderSubTotal) / SUM(OrderGuests) END, 2)
        , Subtotal = SUM(OrderSubTotal)
        , Coupons = ISNULL(SUM(Coupons), 0) * - 1
#+END_SRC

You can even make it a bit more fancy and align the ~=~ signs, which
could improve readability if the expressions are much alike, but would
be harder to maintain.
